        // 1. The Magical Sorting Hat:
        //Imagine you are creating a magical sorting hat for a wizard school. Implement a JavaScript function that takes an array of student names and assigns them to one of the four houses 
        // (Gryffindor (length less than 6), Hufflepuff(length less than 8), Ravenclaw(length less than 12), 
        // or Slytherin(length greater than or equal to 12)) based on the length of their names.

        let arr = ["Shaurya", "anuj", "nitish", "shivam", "ashutosh"]
        let house = arr.map((e) => e.length)
        house = house.map((e) => {
            if (e < 6) return "Gryffindor"
            else if (e < 8) return "Hufflepuf"
            else if (e < 12) return "Ravenclaw"
            else return "Slytherin"
        })
        console.log(arr)
        console.log(house)

        // 10. The Coffee Machine:
        // In your coffee shop application, you need to simulate the process of brewing coffee asynchronously. Write an async
        //  function named brewCoffee that takes the type of coffee and returns a promise. The promise should resolve with a 
        // message indicating that the coffee is ready after a random delay.

        let brewCoffee = (name) => {
            return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
                setTimeout(() => {
                    console.log(`${name} is ready`)
                }, 2000)
            })
